   <h1>About Us</h1>
   <p>We make pencils…. Not just regular pencils…………..the best pencils in the world.
     Or pencil come presharpend with a length of 2ft to make sure one pencil can last 1 week straight.
     We with such a low low price it's hard to believe other pencil companies are still in business.
     With the pencils being two feet long it's hard to believe how big the eraser on the pencil is.
     Welp at POINT PENCILS we decided to make the eraser 5 feet long so that you will be able to get rid of all your mistakes.
     Because our pencils are so long, it is even possible to make houses out of them</p>
